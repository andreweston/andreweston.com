<p>
Andre Weston is an online casino industry expert with multi-decade experience spanning casino operations, payments, player protection, fraud prevention, VIP management, and platform integrity. His expertise is grounded in real operational experience inside major global online casino environments, combined with extensive firsthand player experience across dozens of platforms worldwide.

<p>
In addition to his operator experience, Andre has also spent many years as an active casino player himself. This dual perspective gives him a comprehensive understanding of both the operational realities casinos face and the real-world frustrations and concerns experienced by players.
